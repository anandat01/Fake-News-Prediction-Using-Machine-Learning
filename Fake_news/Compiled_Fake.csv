A video from the White House posted to Obama's Facebook page Wednesday night features a young boy named Alex from New York who wrote to Obama asking to host Omran Daqneesh, the 5-year-old Syrian boy shown in a heartbreaking picture out of Aleppo, Syria. Obama read the letter during a summit on refugees he hosted earlier this week at the UN General Assembly, calling for nations to adopt the same compassion shown by the young boy.
In less than 10 hours, the video posted on Obama's Facebook earned 106 thousand likes and was viewed more than 3 million times.

It gives a tour of Alex’s home as he reads about sharing his toys with Daqneesh, inviting him to birthday parties and hoping he will “teach us another language.”

“The humanity that a young child can display who hasn’t learned to be cynical, or suspicious, or fearful of other people because of how they look or where they’re from or how they pray,” Obama says in the video. “We can all learn from Alex.”"

The general election has been playing out for about two months now, with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton taking direct aim at each other, but tonight will be the first time that they square off directly. Clinton has been preparing for her 35th presidential election debate for weeks. Aides say the former secretary of state — who is known for doing her homework — has been poring over briefing books and practicing in mock debates with a Trump stand-in, Clinton's longtime aide Philippe Reines.

She has said she expects it to be a ""difficult, challenging"" debate. Her campaign has even consulted with ""The Art of the Deal"" ghostwriter Tony Schwartz on how to beat him in a debate.

Trump was in debate prep meetings all day Friday after focusing more on campaigning than studying up for the showdown. Though no mock debates occurred, he was asked rounds of questions he could face from tonight's moderator.

The sessions were led by Trump surrogate and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, along with the campaign leadership. Acknowledging that there are concerns about his tone, Trump has repeatedly said that he plans to be polite — but only to a point.

""I'm going to be very respectful of her,"" Trump said during a interview on Fox News on Thursday.

""I think she deserves that, and I'm going to be nice. And if she's respectful of me, that’ll be nice. We'll have something that I think people will respect as a debate, but we'll see where it all goes. You really never know exactly how it's going to turn out, and that's why we're going to have a lot of people watching,"" he said.

For her part, Clinton and her team have spoken about how they had to prep by facing off against two versions of Trump: the more professional, contained version that has been present on the trail more recently and the more bombastic, uncontrolled version that was seen more during the primaries.

Famous Faces in the Audience
Chelsea Clinton will attend the debate, a first for her this election cycle, after not attending any of the Democratic primary debates.

And another familiar face is expected to be in the front row supporting Team Clinton: Mark Cuban.

The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner is a vocal Clinton supporter and reportedly went so far as to volunteer to play Trump in her mock debates. He said earlier this week that the Clinton team never returned his email offer, but they did keep him in mind for another move. If Cuban is being put in the front row as some kind of psychological ploy, the television audience shouldn't expect to enjoy his presence. Peter Eyre, a senior adviser with the Commission on Presidential Debates, the independent organization that sponsors the events, told ABC News that the live audience will not be on camera during the debate at Hofstra University tonight.

There are expected to be about 1,000 people in the audience."

Billionaire entrepreneur and ""Shark Tank"" co-star Mark Cuban has confirmed that he will be taking a front-row seat at the debate at Hofstra University on Long Island in New York to cheer on Team Hillary. ""Obviously, I'm a not a Trump fan. I am a Clinton fan,"" Cuban told ABC News today at the red carpet season premiere of ""Shark Tank."" ""I think she'd make a great president.

""I don't think he's got the skill set,"" he said about Trump. ""Let's put it this way, if he came on 'Shark Tank,' I wouldn't make the investment. I just don't see him as being capable in the least bit.""

Trump quickly responded to the news by tweeting that he was considering inviting Gennifer Flowers, the variety show performer who famously had an affair with Bill Clinton before he became president. Although Trump's campaign manager told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos that Trump did not actually invite Flowers, it seems she was willing to accept the invitation. Meanwhile, other celebrities are gearing up to watch the first debate between the two candidates. Here's what they are saying on social media:"

If Clinton came looking for a fight, she found it. Her aggressive tone drew Trump in.
He attacked Clinton right back, showing flashes of anger that channeled public frustration and also the coarser side of his public persona.

It made for some lively exchanges, including several that brought an edge to Trump’s tone.

“She doesn’t have the look,” Trump said toward the end of the debate. “She doesn’t have the stamina.”

Trump appeared rattled at times, particularly as the debate wore on. Yet his main attacks on Clinton were rooted in policy grounds, as he sought to give voice to public anger not just at Clinton but at the broader political class.

“You’ve been doing this for 30 years — why are you just thinking about these solutions now?” Trump said in a section of the debate about ways to create jobs.

“I have thought about this quite a bit,” Clinton countered.

“Yeah, for 30 years,” Trump responded.

Trump stretched facts and attacked Clinton’s temperament. He — for the most part — kept his cool.

Debate Fact-Check: How Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Stack Up
First Presidential Debate: 10 Moments That Mattered
Most Memorable Lines of the First Presidential Debate
Throughout the debate, Clinton called Trump “Donald.” He almost always referred to her as “Secretary Clinton” and made sure that was all right with her.

“I want you to be very happy. It’s very important to me,” Trump said, challenging the fact-checkers once again.

Trump was brought onto his shakiest ground of the night when moderator Lester Holt brought up President Barack Obama’s birthplace — specifically why it took Trump until just weeks ago to declare the matter settled.

Trump flatly said, “I say nothing” to those who wonder why he pushed the matter as long as he did. And he falsely accused Clinton of starting the birther question in 2007, claiming credit for putting the issue to rest.

“Just like she can’t bring back jobs, she can’t produce” Obama’s birth certificate, Trump said.

Clinton pounced on an issue with resonance among black voters and other parts of the Obama coalition.

“It can’t be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen,” she said. “The birther lie was a very hurtful one.”

Apparently worried that Trump would be on his best behavior, Clinton started her barrage early. She suggested that Trump’s success is inherited, and that he’s hiding his tax returns to avoid embarrassment.

“Maybe he’s not as rich as he says he is,” she said. “Maybe he’s not as charitable as he claims to be.”

Trump didn’t even bother to deny Clinton’s suggestion that he hasn’t paid income taxes “for a lot of years,” turning even that into an argument against the status quo.

“It would be squandered too, believe me,” Trump said.

Clinton also found a groove in attacking Trump on Iraq. Trump again insisted that he was against the Iraq War before it started, a statement for which there is no public record in support of his claim.

For his part, Trump took Clinton on consistently, attacking her on jobs, trade and national security, using her as a stand-in for politicians in general.

“I have a feeling that by the end of this evening, I’m going to be blamed for everything that ever happened,” Clinton said at one point.

Trump: “Why not?”

Clinton: “Just join the debate by saying more crazy things.”

Clinton had one of her better moments in declaring her fitness for office, keying off of Trump’s criticism of her for retreating from the campaign trail.

“Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did,” she said. “And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that’s a good thing.”

Later in the debate, Trump allowed that Clinton has experience, “but it’s bad experience,” he said.

“This country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience,” Trump said.

After the first extraordinary encounter between two extraordinarily unpopular nominees, the plays are clear. Clinton is putting her experience up against the anger Trump is channeling, anger that has two distinct sides to it.

They proved they can get under each other’s skin. But neither candidate proved that he or she has a winning message, not on the night of the first debate.

1.02E+16,mainstream,Politico,https://www.facebook.com/politico/posts/10153850823751680,9/23/2016,link,FALSE,,61,608,92,Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump,"writing as a former legislative assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of Hillary Clinton for president, I was disappointed to see in Politico the screed written by my former colleague, Adam Walinsky, excoriating Clinton’s record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that Donald Trump should therefore be elected president. It is one thing to disagree with Secretary Clinton, which Walinsky does heatedly, and quite another to turn to Donald Trump.

We should be clear that Walinsky’s critique is not confined to Clinton. He lays out (and massively overstates) a dark view not just of Clinton but also of President Obama and almost the entire Democratic Party. The analysis is overwrought, but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is Trump. The question is not whether there is a military-industrial complex in our country. President Eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it. The 21st century version begins with the Iraq War, which was originated by a Republican President. I am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that Presidents Obama, Clinton and Carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways. The question here is whether Donald Trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for a foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot. Yes, we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors. But electing Donald Trump is not the answer; it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways. The answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither American security interests nor egregious human rights violations—a topic in which Donald Trump has shown an ostentatious indifference, as his fondness for Vladimir Putin reflects.

All the evidence, provided again and again by Donald Trump’s own mouth, tells us not that he is a man of peace, but that he is a man of no principle—a man who will say, and possibly do, whatever happens to cross his mind at a given minute. He is like the weather in New England: If you don’t like it, wait a minute. We do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes. We do not know what he knows because, from all we can see, he does not know much.

Even if Walinsky’s diatribe is correct, which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth, there is nothing in it that justifies turning to Donald Trump. Of all occasions to break ranks with the Democratic Party, this is the most inappropriate. Of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of John and Robert Kennedy, two of our greatest public servants, this is the most egregious I have ever seen.

To say that I am disappointed by what Walinsky has done is an understatement. America, in this election, faces an existential question—and history will judge us by our answer. Walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle."

Manafort, as well as his business associated and fellow Trump campaign official Rick Gates have been taken into federal custody, but both have laughably entered pleas of not guilty to all kinds of high crimes   including really shady stuff like money laundering and conspiracy against their own country.Of course, the Trump White House is in all-out  nothing to see here  mode.

As if this weren t bad enough for Team Trump, a third person in their orbit has been charged as well, foreign policy adviser George Padadopoulos.

Research conducted over a four year period during which  U.S. residents experienced 5.8 million violent victimizations each year  found that the rate of white-on-white violent crime (12.0 per 1,000) was almost four times higher than black-on-white violent crime (3.1 per 1,000).However, even when the facts are blatantly obvious and staring them right in the face, there is no swaying some Republicans who still subscribe to the idea that African-Americans are still the largest threat to themselves and others. Case in point: former White House advisor Sebastian Gorka in this interview last Monday:On a Sinclair station, Gorka refers to ""black African crime on black African crime"" & says black men are killing each other ""by the bushel"" pic.twitter.com/Cbtqm39tTd  Yashar Ali ?

One of the most dramatically difficult things to fathom in this country is the amount of lives lost   black lives lost   as a result of black-on-black violence,  Hill said on Saturday. In the same year that we experienced about 259 police officer shootings of blacks in 2015, there were 6,000 black lives lost to murders from black people. However, contrary to what both Mr. Gorka and Mr. Hill believe, black men aren t killing each other  by the bushel.  In fact, according to the report, black-on-black violence has decreased exponentially in the last two decades, by almost the exact same rate as white-on-white violence. From 1994 to 2015, white-on-white violence and black-on-black violence declined at a similar rate. White-on-white violence declined 79 percent (from 52.5 to 10.8 victimizations per 1,000 white persons). Black-on-black violence declined 78 percent (from 66.6 to 14.5 victimizations per 1,000 black persons).

Standing up to Donald Trump is pretty unpopular among Republicans these days, and we ve seen the proof in how quickly the base turned on some otherwise solidly-conservative GOP Senators who have decided the age of Trump is just too much for them.First Tennessee s Bob Corker then McCain s fellow Arizona Senator Jeff Flake dropped out of the running for reelection, possibly dashing the GOP s hopes for holding on to the Senate in the 2018 elections. But regardless of the fact that they ve both been what old Mitt Romney might call  severely conservative,  red meat Trump voters turned on the two like villagers with pitchforks.That could be, however, because they don t have the credentials John McCain has. When he trolled Trump hard last week on the  bone spurs  he used as an excuse to dodge the draft with all of his silver spoon, private school pals, Trump tried to clap back with a warning that  people have to be careful because at some point I fight back. McCain s answer? I have faced tougher adversaries. Now, you might think Donald Trump is at least smart enough not to come at a former POW with some weak stuff like that, but you d be wrong. Laughably wrong. In fact, go ahead and have a little laugh, because you re in good company.McCain thought it was hilarious.Appearing on The View the following day, the panel gave the senior Arizona Senator a chance to expound a little on his short response to the president s threat: He said he would  fight back  and it wouldn t be pretty. Are you scared? McCain didn t answer immediately because he was busy laughing his ass off. No, I mean, almost with tears in his eyes. There he is, next to his daughter   who just landed the spot on this show   and this old man looks like he s going to cry from laughing so hard. Every woman on the panel is cracking up.

There are two problems with that: First, to accept a pardon is to admit guilt, so he d be throwing them under the bus. But secondly, and perhaps more importantly, any pardons he issues could land him in hot water just that much sooner. According to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), his pardoning power is not exactly absolute.Schiff told ABC News: I don t think the president s power is all that absolute, as people have been suggesting.The president cannot pardon people if it s an effort to obstruct justice, if it s an effort to prevent Bob Mueller and others from learning about the President s own conduct. So, there are limitations. This whole thing really took off when Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate whether Trump obstructed justice when he fired James Comey. It s true that the Constitution does give the president broad power to issue pardons for  offenses against the United States.  However, we currently don t have any precedent for a president pardoning people tied to his own campaign, and rumors have been circulating that Trump wants to test his pardoning powers to see just how far they actually go.That could be part of why the Tweeter-In-Chief was panicking so badly on Twitter that he screamed,  DO SOMETHING!  in a rant about Hillary Clinton and Uranium One. He might be aware that not only is Mueller getting closer to something that implicates him, which we just can t have, but also that he can t pardon anyone Mueller indicts (or perhaps has been strongly warned away from trying).A pardon would require an admission of guilt, but it would also prevent people from flipping on Trump and singing out the truth in exchange for lesser charges or a lesser sentence. Depending on who s indicted, and what they do, the man who would be king in the White House will find it far more difficult to keep claiming that Russia is just a distraction and there s nothing to it.And so will all his lackeys.Too bad.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images"

And Charles isn t the only one coming up with horrific numbers, either. The Kaiser Family Foundation has done their own analysis and come up with some pretty damning numbers as well.The worst part is that the markets were starting to stabilize going into this year, which meant premium hikes would likely have slowed for next year, and maybe even started coming down in following years. Instead, they re now skyrocketing. Polls have also consistently shown growing support for fixing the ACA instead of repealing it. What Trump and his party did was a planned and deliberate political move to harm Obama s legacy without caring who else they hurt.These extreme premium hikes are on Trump s and the GOP s heads.

Now that she is a private citizen who has zero intention of running for office ever again, the former First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, and 2016 Democratic Presidential nominee can speak her mind, and she did so in spectacular fashion at a dinner on Saturday night for the Human Rights Campaign. While speaking to the nation s largest LGBTQIA rights organization, Hillary turned her attentions to Fox News, the network that seems obsessed with her, even though she is a private citizen, and their criminal orange poster boy is the one who is currently squatting in the White House. Hillary said of Fox: It does strike me that in the last few days at least, Fox News seems to think that s where I live, in the White House. Because they spend a disproportionate amount of their time talking about impeaching me. So, look, if they want to make a trade, I d be more than willing. I would have much preferred to have come to the dinner tonight from a slightly closer residence. That s a trade I d be all for   and millions of other Americans feel the same way. The deeper issue here, though, is that Fox, like the rest of the world, knows that an indictment is coming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Monday, and they have no way to spin their way out of this one. So, what do they do instead? Tell their brainwashed viewers that Hillary Clinton is the real criminal here, and that Donald Trump is being witch hunted by the  fake media.  They whip those right-wing nuts up into a frenzy, all so that they can keep them just the way they like them: angry, ignorant, and frightening of boogie men on the left who don t exist.Give  em hell, Hillary.

Oh is that today?  Clinton said, linking Silver s tweet.The article Silver links notes that the letter Comey sent to Congress telling them the FBI had learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation  into Clinton s private email server,  upended the news cycle and soon halved Clinton s lead in the polls, imperiling her position in the Electoral College. Republicans and the majority of the media shoved the letter in the American people s faces seemingly non-stop, sticking us with the useless egomaniacal danger to our country who, unlike his predecessor, is embroiled in a legitimate scandal that actually threatens the future of our nation, that we know and hate today.It s good to see that Clinton was able to keep her sense of humor through all of this.

Remember, this is the same man who filed a $5 billion libel lawsuit against author Timothy O Brien for causing  actual malice  by claiming that Trump was only a multi-millionaire, not a billionaire.Since he s been in office, President Trump has had a fixation on size, from exaggerating the size of the crowd present at his inauguration and other public appearances, to that of the size of his Manhattan penthouse in Trump Tower and even the height of the building itself for that matter.Trump is not a small man, standing around 6 1 , although I ll say 6 2  to save myself from any legal ramifications, but he does have a clear-cut Napoleonic complex.People have been giving Trump a hard time about the size of his hands since the 1980s when Spy magazine dubbed him a short-fingered vulgarian.  The references to the size of then-candidate Trump s hands gathered steam again during his presidential campaign, something that has stuck in his craw to this day with the President still feeling the need to justify his hand size.  My hands are too big!  he said as he attempted to put on a pair of latex gloves while serving meals in early September to those affected by Hurricane Harvey in Houston.If one man could be that affected by a claim that he has small hands, then how would he feel if his entire body were small? We don t exactly know yet, but people are photoshopping Trump to appear small in photos to hilarious effect to get under his skin and the results are just brilliant.There are several approaches photo manipulators are taking, the most obvious being to make him out to be the child that he is:Others are just opting to make Trump seem tiny in general, but particularly when he s in the company of other world leaders:If there s one way to drive a sexist crazy, it is to make them seem minuscule in the presence of a woman, particularly family members. In Trump s case, there s the added advantage of making that woman his arch nemesis, Hilary Clinton:This is a trend that is certainly going to go viral so if you think you ve got some photoshop skills, it s time to get to work and feel free to post your masterpieces in the comments.Featured image via screenshot"

The first official charges have been filed according to CNN, and someone may well be taken into custody in just a few days. While the House and Senate seem to be throwing in the towel on their investigations, and Republicans including Trump himself are ramping up their calls for investigations into Hillary and Uranium One, Mueller is still doing his job.CNN has an exclusive story on this. The charges are currently sealed by order of a federal judge, and Mueller s office would not comment. However, they say: Plans were prepared Friday for anyone charged to be taken into custody as soon as Monday, the sources said. It is unclear what the charges are. Mueller was appointed special counsel shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. The original investigation was into whether Trump obstructed justice in firing Comey, but lately, he and his team have been interviewing everyone from Paul Manafort to Michael Flynn   both of whom have known ties to Russia and pro-Russia groups.Mueller s office has also been looking into a meeting between Don Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and a Russian attorney who claimed to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Don Jr. even said he  loved it  when he said he d take the meeting. He promptly lied about it, saying it was about adoptions, and then released emails proving he lied.Since it s not clear what the charges are or who they re against, there are all sorts of possibilities.

Noting that Wilson was currently at the funeral of fallen soldier La David Johnson while Trump was playing golf, Reid said: She is at that funeral as we speak. While General Kelly and his boss, Donald Trump, are still standing by their attacks on her. Like I said, extraordinary. Then, she turned to one of her guests, retired Colonel Jack Jacobs, and asked: Donald Trump likes to hide behind his generals, he likes to push them out front in order to give himself credibility. What do you make of General Kelly s willingness to be used in that way this week and then to add this extraneous story that turns up not even to be true slamming the congresswoman? It was as if Jacobs, a Medal of Honor recipient, had been waiting all day for the opportunity to rip Trump and Kelly apart. He said: Well, it s quite surprising because I know   I don t know him very well, I m not that close to him   but I know General Kelly I m quite surprised. Attacks like this don t make any sense from anybody. The retired colonel, who is also the recipient of two Silver Stars, three Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts, also stated that Trump and Kelly owed Wilson an apology: If it were I, I would. I mean, I d pick up the phone and say,  look, this has gone far enough, I apologize.  But that should have been the case from the very beginning when whatever is emanating from the White House was inaccurate as well. And the trashing continued with this brilliant attack: I can say this about Donald Trump, he s not real good at talking. If I were Trump, I would have picked up the phone and said,  look, that was my ham-handed way of being sympathetic, I m not good at that and I apologize.  And all this stuff would have been over. Another guest, a former combat veteran, agreed with Jacobs, while Reid reminded everyone that  It s not going to stop because Donald Trump this morning, got up bright and early and starting tweeting again attacking Congresswoman Wilson. So Donald Trump doesn t want it to end and he doesn t want the discussion to be about the fact it took him 13 days to call the families of these four fallen soldiers. He wants it to be about Congresswoman Wilson. Here s that tweet:As usual, Trump just makes things worse for himself. Jacobs was dead on when he stated that Trump could have easily ended this whole debacle by apologizing for his disgusting response and all the lies. But because he s Trump, we all knew that wasn t going to happen.

She attacks anyone and everyone who dares to criticize Trump as saboteurs who wish to take the victory of Trump and his base away. You see, to these people, those who do not support Trump are the REAL threat to the republic, not Trump s fascist, authoritarian regime. Loesch s statement culminates in the following chilling statement: From the highest levels of government, to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us. So, educational institutions, the free press, anyone and everyone who sees the dangers of Trumpism   we must be dealt with. It comes complete with violent imagery and creepy music to boot.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2017That s right! Donald Trump will finally be opening that presidential book hidden in the Library of Congress (and found by Nicolas Cage) that contains all of the secrets passed down from president to president across the ages to reveal what really happened to JFK.Just kidding! Despite the fact that he tried to make it sound like it was his idea, and happening only under his authority, it turns out that the  JFK FILES,  as he so loudly put it, were scheduled to be released no later than next Thursday, October 26, 2017. Coincidentally, that date is exactly 25 years to the day after the  President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992  was passed by the 102nd Congress.Okay, I m kidding again. Democratic Senator and American hero John Glenn introduced the bill in July of that year   likely while production was wrapping up on Donald Trump s star cameo in the Hollywood blockbuster  Home Alone 2: Lost In New York. Especially relevant in the text of the bill is Section 2, which discusses the reasoning behind Senator Glenn s proposal of it.Isn t it weird, how Trump really emphasized the fact that the  JFK FILES  were  long blocked and classified  and that he was gonna do something about it? I mean, besides the fact that all he s actually doing is allowing an existing law to, uh, continue to exist and carry out as planned. No, what s weird is WHO  long blocked and classified  those files. John Glenn (who may or may not know the truth about the moon landing) was kind enough not to name the sitting president he was indicting in this bill for obstructing the files  release, but the math is pretty simple: From July to October of 1992, the entire time this bill was debated until its passage, the person referred to as  the executive branch  was former president (and even former-er CIA Chief) George H.W. Bush.A Republican. As usual.Anyway, thanks, Trumpykins! We really appreciate you, uh, not stopping this thing that was totally going to happen even if you d been hit by a meteor the day you admitted you were a sexual predator.

You can be this guy that everybody says  you are the man of unimpeachable integrity,  or you can take political hit shots and be the hatchet man. You can t do both. Maher is correct. Kelly s integrity is no longer unimpeachable, because he chose to utter provable lies from the White House press podium and has also chosen not to apologize for it. He defended the indefensible with regards to Trump s appalling statements to the Myeshia Johnson, the grieving widow of Army Sergeant La David Johnson. With that, Kelly smeared something that is supposed to be sacred, and he cannot take that back.I never thought I d say this about a man who has given so much to this country   including his own son   but here it is: Shame on you, John Kelly.
